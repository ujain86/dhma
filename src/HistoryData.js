<p align="justify" class="style6">Delhi Hindustani Merchantile  Association is an association of Cloth Traders, Textile Mill Owners, Bankers, Transporters  and Importers working from more than 125 years. DHMA has got a history of more  than 125 years but the official records are available only from 1893 when DHMA  came into force on papers. Its formation was during the British rule in India. &nbsp;In the British rule the name Dehli Hindustani  Merchantile Association was a matter of Pride as using the word HINDUSTANI in  British rule was for an association was really daring and commendable for which  we traders will never forget the dareness of our forefathers.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">Probably DHMA is the only  Association in India  which is having its own written Constitution from 1893 and still working on the  written Constitution till today.&nbsp; The  Constitution of DHMA is so strongly made by our forefathers that till today all  the other Associations in any trade follow the Constitution of DHMA. The  constitution is being amended from time to time due to necessary requirements  of the trade.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">Textile trade has always been the  backbone of Indian economy. As in the British rule the Government ruled all the  states of India.  The Indian cloth trade attracted attention of the British Textile Industrialists  who realized that Indian Cloth Trade has lot of potential. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">In those days handloom  manufacturers captured most of the Indian Cloth Business. British Manufacturers  established Mills (mechanized system of manufacturing cloth) and made Manchester the biggest cloth manufacturing centre in Britain. The  trend was followed by Germany,  France Italy and other European Countries. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">These foreign mills started  selling their fabrics in India  by setting up offices in Delhi.  In those days most of the cloth was distributed in India  through Delhi. Delhi had its own cloth  distribution Character. It was not possible for Foreign Mills to regulate the  whole cloth trade. So they adopted the existing distribution Character of Delhi  and started selling their cloth in India  through distribution cloth system of Delhi.  They use to get orders of cloth through Indent forms filled by the Textile  Traders from Delhi and other territories of India and  supply imported cloth accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">It was natural for disputes to  arise in such a large trading system. Around 1886-87 a need to solve these  disputes between cloth community arose. According to the available information  in around 1890 disputes were used to be solved by Seth Snehi Ram in the  capacity of Panch from his shop from Katra Asharfi through arbitration. His  decisions regarding the disputes were generally acceptable. Due to the pressure  of work and business traders preferred to solve disputes through mutual  understanding and arbitration instead of going to Court for business related  disputes. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">This system of solving disputes  through Panch was effective but traders worried that if in future if effective  Panch will not be available the whole system of arbitration will flop. Shri  Ramlal Khemka son of Shri Snehi Ram wanted to evolve a system of arbitration of  solving disputes among the parties. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">A Delhi Cloth Committee named Dehli  Hindustani Merchantile Association was established in later half of 1893 with the  support of Seth Snehi Ram, Seth Ram Prasad, Lal Beni Prasad, Seth Bakshi Ram,  Lala Ganesh Dass, Lala Banarsi Dass and many others. After the formation of  DHMA Disputes between cloth trade community were settled by DHMA through its  President and Secretary but if Parties were not satisfied with the judgment  they could take the dispute to Court of Law but with the permission of DHMA.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">In the former meeting of  association Lala Banasi Dass was nominated as President, Seth Snehi Ram,  Secretary and Lala Ganesh Dass Ji, Joint Secretary. After the death of Lala Banarsi  Das his son Lala Beni Prasad Ji was elected President. The first annual report  of the association was published in 1914.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">Traders could sell or purchase or  indent the cloth only after becoming the member of DHMA. Association use to  give Indent forms to the traders, only after filling indent form traders could  get cloth for selling in the market. This was the reason why offices of foreign  Mills also became members of Dehli Hindustani Merchantile Association. Along  with the traders, banks, transporters of Delhi, banks,  transporters from Agra, Amritsar,  Kanpur and  other north Indian cities also became members.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">In the meantime British Traders  formed another organization Peace Goods Association. Only importers were its  members. Their members also had to take indent form from DHMA for purchase of  fabric so they were also dependent on DHMA for trading. DHMA was still the  effective Association for Cloth manufacturers, traders and transporters. Executive  of Peace Goods Association had four British Traders, Two Muslims and six  Hindus. This racial nature of executive and some problems in the functioning  this organization were unable to work for too long and finally came to an end.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">DHMA was systematically working  and through elections on February 2, 1914 traders formed the executive  committee with Seth Snehi Ram Ji - President, Seth Ramlal Ji Khemka- Vice  President, Seth Beni Prasad Ji- Secretary, Seth Bakshi Ram Ji- Joint Secretary,  Shri Kanahiya Lal Ji- Treasurer. Seth Ramlal Ji Khemka use to devote most of  his time in systemic working of the Association.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">After the death of Seth Snehi Ram  Ji his son Seth Ramlal Ji Khemka became the President. On elections held on  April 23, 1918 the executive committee was Seth Ram Lal Ji Khemka- President,  Lala Jagannath &amp; Seth Laxmi Narayan Gadodia - Vice President, Rai Sahib  Lala Gurprasad Kapoor- Secretary, Seth Kedar Nath &amp; Seth Bakshi Ram &ndash; Joint  Secretary, Lala Ram Richpal &ndash; Treasurer. Seth Ramlal Ji Khemka served the  association as President for 24 years 1918- 1942.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">This was the time when due to World War-I import of cloth  came to an end. This led to encouragement of production of indigenous cloth and  Indian Textile Mills flourished.&nbsp; DHMA was  the only one which was smoothly working in such difficult times also.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">World War-I created a problem in the working of British  Cloth producers, they could not sell cloth in their own name. They opened shops  in the name of Indian Importer and started textile trade. These shops were the competitors  with Indian traders.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6">Association could not tolerate this so they started the  Boycott Movement of these foreign traders. As a result they had to close shops.  British Government pressurized DHMA to stop boycotting foreign traders but DHMA  did not take back their Boycott Movement. </p>     `

<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1923 Mahatma Gandhi started  the Non- Cooperation movement. To support this movement many DHMA members  cancelled their orders of imported fabrics for which they had to suffer great  loss, their patriotism was praiseworthy. Traders who did not want to break  trade commitments and wanted to stay loyal towards India faced greater problems. In  1932 &ndash; 33 Delhi Cloth merchants as loyal Indians supported the boycott of  imported fabric. The whole of North India  followed them. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Till now DHMA had become the apex  association of traders in Dehli. In 1922 Government gave the right to DHMA to  send their one representative to Dehli Municipal Committee. Seth Ramlal Khemka  was the first nominated representative of DHMA to go to Municipal Committee.  During the tenure of Lala Atma Ram Sahavaisa this right was taken back. To  reinforce this right DHMA kept making efforts and in 1950 DHMA got the right  back and could again send their one representative to Delhi Municipal  Committee. In getting this right back Lala Deshbandhu Gupta and Sir Lala Sri  Ram gave incredible contribution.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Association has firmly solved  disputes within textile community in harmonious atmosphere since the beginning.  It will not be an exaggeration to say that Panchayati way of governance which  the Indian Democratic Government wants to establish has been smoothly working in  DHMA from last 120 years which has been appreciated by all. Even opposition  could not criticize the working of association. It is a matter of pride for the  association that it gave total opportunity to parties to present their side in  the dispute before the panel of Panch. Late Shri Asaf Ali graced the  association with his presence to listen to the disputes in the association.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Association has not only solved  disputes between the traders but has contributed greatly for the growth of  textile trade by removing problems arising in trade from time to time. Not only  traders but Industrialists, Importers, Exporters, Banks etc. have also been  members of the association.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">DHMA has always supported trade  and traders. During Second World War association struggled to revolt against  government policy of ration and control. These were the testing times for the  association. It had to bear great loss by not paying ration and control tax; Dehli  trade distribution system also faced loss. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Rai Saheb Gurprasad Kapoor use to  work as devotedly as Shri Ram Lal Khemka was doing ealier. After Shri Ram Lal  Khemka resigned in June 1941 Rai Saheb Gurprasad Kapoor was elected President  with majority. Rai Sahab Lal Ram Prasad was elected the Secretary.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1942 Country faced the  shortage of fabric, so rationing system on cloth was imposed on textile. This  created a problem for textile traders. Quota was fixed for every state. Quota  for Dehli was 10000 bales according to its population. Licensing system was  imposed on cloth distribution. In the beginning three members of DHMA got the  license, DHMA opposed this. Members demanded that traders who have ancestral  textile business should get the license. Lala Harprasad Aggarwal was elected  Secretary in those days and in his leadership an action committee was formed. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Action committee met the Director  of Civil Supplies and warned him that they will go on Satyagraha and then on  Hunger Strike if licenses are not given. As a result all the cloth traders were  given license. But they did not agree that textile exported from Dehli should  be exported through Dehli traders only. Action committee went to Bombay and gave  memorandum to the Textile Commissioner Sir Akbar Haideri. They got the quota of  13000bales and permission to sell textile to neighboring states as a result Delhi became the centre  for textile distribution.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">&nbsp;In 1942 Mahatma Gandhi started the Quit India  Movement. As a result atmosphere of loots, arrests, strikes etc was created in Delhi. Textile traders  went to jails, shops became empty, and trade was closed. Association and its  members fought with the freedom fighters to attain independence for India. Association  encouraged handlooms in this period. Handloom trade flourished and Delhi remained the  textile distribution centre as before. The members of DHMA also burnt the  foreign cloth as a Holi on the call of Mahatma Gandhi at the Clock Tower of  Chandni Chowk.</p>`},

<p align="justify" class="style3">The association got registered on  5 February 1946 under Union Trade Union Registration Act 1938.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">On August 15, 1947 as a result of  agreement India  was divided. Lacs of refugees came to Delhi  and started textile trading for their livelihood. Katras of Chandni Chowk  became the textile trading centers. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1947 control was imposed on  textile. A delegation with the support of Lala Ram Charan Agarwal and in the  leadership of Lala Gurprasad Kapoor met Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi realized  the adverse effect of control on textile and came to the annual general meeting  of DHMA on December 14, 1947. Mahatma Gandhi assured the textile traders to  give his full support. But unfortunately on January 30, 1948 he was  assassinated.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1949 elections of DHMA Rai  Saheb Guprasad Kapoor was elected the President and Shri Brij Bhushan Saran the  Secretary. The adverse effect of control on textile was not only on textile  traders of Delhi but whole India. The  control policy became rigid and quota of 30000 bales which Delhi got as quota was also stopped. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">To create an impact on the  government association organized an All India Textile Traders Conference on 23,  24 December 1947. President of DHMA Lala Gurprasad Kapoor presided over the  conference and President of Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and  Industries (FICCI) Shri Lalji Malhotra inaugurated it. In the conference it was  decided that if government will not agree to the demands of traders they will  go on strike and if required on hunger strike. DHMA is the founder member of  FICCI also and played a great role in the formation of FICCI.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Minister of Industries and Civil  Supply Shri Shyama Prasad Mukerjee as informed about this, but he did not gave  a satisfactory reply. Helpless traders kept token strike on 2.1.1950. As per  decision when no response was received from government till January 15, 1950 traders  went on indefinate strike from January 16, 1950. Strike got good support from  newspapers. Assembly member Shri Deshbandhu Gupta called it unfortunate for the  country and arranged their meeting with Minister of Industries and Civil Supply  Shri Shyama Prasad Mukerjee. He appealed to traders to call off their strike  and assured them a proper action in this. Soon Delhi  traders got permission to supply textile to nearby states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh etc. Central Government also gave  permission to supply stitched cloth. But the permit for this could easily be  obtained after recommendation from the association without which it was  difficult to get permit.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Textile Mills had the right to  print rates on fabric. But this policy was misused. Mills had no practical base  of printing rates on cloth; they use to print whatever prices they wanted to.  To show that mills do not print correct rates and consumers are exploited an  exhibition was organized. The finance and civil supply minister Shri  Harekrishan Mehtab visited the exhibition and agreed that rates are printed in  incorrect manner and assured corrective measures for it.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Permit for supply of stitched  clothes to nearby states could be obtained only after recommendation from the  association. Traders started misusing this permission and use to supply  unstitched textile in the bales of stitched cloth. To control this Government  and Association together appointed Lala Ugrasen Singhal to check the bales  before dispatch. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">On January 26, 1950 India  was declared &lsquo;Sovereign Democratic Republic&rsquo;.  Government decided to celebrate 26 January as Republic Day. The President in <strong>Ceremonial Parade</strong> drove  out of the Government House (now Rastrapati Bhawan) in a 35-year-old coach  specially renovated for the occasion bearing the new emblem of Ashoka's capital  and drawn by six sturdy Australian horses. The route was very small presently  known as Janpath with a parade of 3000 officers and jawans of all the three  Armed Services of India and the Police with massed bands had taken positions  for the Ceremonial Parade.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Association  requested the Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru to extend the route of  parade so that common citizens of India also get a chance to see the  Republic Day Parade. Chandni Chowk had been the prime centre of freedom fight  so the parade should pass from Chandni Chowk. Government relised the importance  of DHMA suggestion and extended the route till Red Fort passing through  different parts of old Delhi  and Chandni Chowk. On the route of the parade many welcome gates were made by  DHMA. Central Government awarded association for this. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">To give appropriate place and to  promote usage of mother tongue Hindi association advised all its members to do  the correspondence and written work in Hindi. For this public awareness  campaign through posters and appeals was run.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Control on cloth was main reason  of corruption, association kept opposing it. As a result permission to sell  textile outside Delhi  without permit was given on November 19, 1953. Although the permission to send  textile outside Delhi  was received but Civil Supply Minister Shri Chanbdra Bhan Gupt wanted that  traders of Uttar Pradesh should directly get textile. When no solution could be  reached Chief Minister of Dehli Chaudhary Brahmprakash said he will ban entry  of trucks in Delhi and no truck will be allowed  to enter Delhi  without permission. This made an effect and Uttar Pradesh government on  November 1952 removed the ban imposed by it.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Association started publishing Mercantile  Newsletter namely called &lsquo;Merchantile Bulletin&rsquo; on August 15, 1950. Orders  which were passed by government in English were translated into Hindi and  activities of the association were published in it. Traders could not  understand the orders passed by government in English so could not follow them  and had to face problems like challan etc. Publication of newsletter gave Hindi  translation of orders passed in English in every 15 days. Shri Krishan Murari  Rohatgi who gave the idea of publishing bulletin was given the responsibility  of editor of bulletin.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Supreme Court of India under  section 286 on March 30, 1953 that no tax will be charged on textile sent from  one state to another. But trader sending the goods in any state will have to  get registered according to the sales tax of receiving state. Local government  can charge sale tax from January 26, 1950. This created a problem for the traders.  Association opposed it; they met the Parliamentary Secretary B.R, Bhagat and  took his support. As a result in Rajkot  on Deputy Finance Minister Shri S.C. Shah announced that no state will charge  sale tax and central government cancelled the order of charging sales tax.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Association kept making efforts  to remove sale tax. An All India Traders conference was organized on 8-9 May  1954 in this context; it was presided over by Minister Shri S.K. Patil. In the  conference it was decided that request will be made to government to amend  section 286.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Delhi Government formed advisory  committee in 1954; Shri Gauri Shanker Goenka represented the Association in it.  The same year Shri Brij Bhushan Sharan name was nominated to represent  association in University Court.  The executive members of DHMA were also nominated as the Honorary Magistrates.  During this period Shri Brij Bhushan Saran, Lala Ganpat Rai, Shri Hem Chand  Jain &amp; Shri Om Prakash Jain were the Honorary Magistrates attending the  regular Courts of Delhi.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1954 elections the same  executive committee was repeated.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">To remove Control on Cloth, State  Sale Tax and make them easy association constantly kept making efforts. In 1953  another organization United chamber of Commerce was formed DHMA became member  of it. They together raised voice for the removal of control and state sale tax  on cloth. President Rai Sahib Lala Gurprasad Kapoor and Sardar Raunak Singh big  industrialists and Ex-President of FICCI taking Member of Parliament in  confidence raised the issue in Parliament also.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">This year many reputed people  like Shri K.R. Bhagat, Lala Radharaman- MP, Shri Thakur Das- MP, Smt. Sucheta  Kriplani, Acharya Shri Kriplani and Dehli Government Minister Shri Shiv Charan  came to association.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">The diamond jubilee of the  organization was celebrated this year.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1955 no change was seen in the  executive. State government formed &lsquo;Textile Committee&rsquo; to give its view on  different problems of textile trade. Lala Ganpat Rai ji represented association  in it.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">The same year Dehli Government formed  &lsquo;Trade Enquiry Committee&rsquo;. Suggestion from different associations were invited  by the government, DHMA also gave their suggestions which were given due  importance by the government. In elections 1956-57 Rai Sahib Gurprasad Kapoor  was reelected the President and Lala Ganpat Rai became the Secretary.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">The status of state from Delhi was taken back by  the government. Association easily accepted this decision but wanted their one  representative should be there in Delhi Municipal Corporation. But government  did not accept this.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">On September 20, 1956 in the divine  guidance of Acharya Tulsi, originator of Anuvrat movement a trader&rsquo;s conference  was organized in Town Hall. Central Finance Minister Shri Morarji Desai  addressed the conference. Acharya emphasized the importance of truth and morals  in business.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1958 same executive continued with  little change. Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries called  an All India Traders Conference on February 25, 1960 which was inaugurated by  Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru. Sir Lala Sri Ram (D.C.M.), Shri Ghanshyam  Das Birla, Shri Rama Swamy Mudliyar and many reputed people participated in it.  Shri Brij Bhushan Sharan, Shri Hem Chand Jain and Shri Ugerasen Singhal  represented association in it. Discussions on how to systematically run trade  were held in it.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1961-62 important changes took  place in executive. Shri Brij Bhushan Saran was elected the President. Prime  Minister Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri laid the foundation of Merchantile  Association Bhawan on 10.8.62 at Queens Garden  (near Hardayal Library), Chandni Chowk. Central Minister Shri Jaisukhlal Hathi,  Ex-Mayor Lala Shamnath, Shri Ramvharan Agarwal, Deputy Commissioner Shri Bose  Malik and many prestigious leaders, government officers and representatives of  association were present on the occasion.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">In 1963-64 and 1965-66 elections  the same executive was elected. These years are extraordinary as it has been  mentioned before that to provide textile at reasonable rate government had  implemented the policy of printing rate on textile. This policy was misused and  Mills use to print arbitrary rates on textile. To take a strong step against  this an All India Textile Traders Conference was organized which was  inaugurated by Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. On the occasion Federation  of All India Cloth Merchant Association was formed, Shri Navneet Bhai Lallu  Shah of Peace Goods Mahajan Bombay was elected the first President. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">Looking at the growing trade end  export from Dehli association requested the government to make a Dry Port  in Dehli.

<p align="justify" class="style3">In year 1967-68 and 69 changes  were not seen in executive. Shri Brij Bhusan Sharan remained the President and  Shri Ganpat Rai Secretary. In 1967 association also got the permission to sell  postal stamps and other postal material from Indian Postal Department, this was  very helpful for the traders.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3">On 8-9 December 1967 All India  Traders Conference was organized in Vigyan Bhawan in which traders from all  over India  participated. In this conference discussions were held on &lsquo;Ten Year Plan&rsquo;,  after the discussion trade leaders suggested that &lsquo;Ten Year Plan&rsquo; will be a  hurdle in smooth business operations so it should not be implemented.</p>            `},
